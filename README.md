## Challenges and Solutions
This was the largest project we had undertaken involving the use of all our front-end knowledge, so it was quite a challenge.

  * Challenge #1: Layout and general CSS

  Before we could do much with the website, we had to make sure that everything looked good and was where we wanted it to be. Once we had accomplished that, and made sure that everything looked the way we wanted it to (such as our background images being being able to withstand being smushed on small screens), we were able to jump into the rest of the project fairly easily.

  * Challenge #2: Breakpoints

  Breakpoints for various screen sizes were a unique challenge, since we opted to not use bootstrap for them. We had to make sure some things were always visible on the page (such as our Services/About/Contact) and that our layout wasnâ€™t ruined by even the smallest size possible (mobile).

  * Challenge #3: API calls

  By far our greatest challenge, integrating an API into the website left us scratching our heads for a while. Although we had used APIs before, we were still a bit unsure of how to proceed in using them properly. We eventually managed to get what we wanted to work, with the help of Rob and the DIRs.

  * Challenge #4: Javascript

  Since we wanted to make sure our website was responsive when the user would input data for their trips, we had to make sure our javascript worked well. Thankfully, it turned out to not be that much of an issue, except for the javascript for our API.

## Future Goals
  * Fully flesh out the API.

  * Work on some smaller things, such as our social media buttons or our newsletter
